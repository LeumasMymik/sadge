# About SadgeHub

Welcome to SadgeHub! This project was created for our CIT 481/L Senior Design project at California State University: Northridge. Our group is comprised of five aspiring IT students. SadgeHub is a website that allows users to sign up for a 100% **free** account that unlocks exclusive content for members. To sign up, all you need is an active email!

# Tools Used 

These are the tools we are planning to use

* GitHub
  * GitHub was used for collaboration on the project. By using GitHub to store our code, we are all able to make various changes to our project and update the code from the comfort of our command line. GitHub is a great way to store, manage, update and share code
* Node.js
  * We plan to build our website using Node.js. Node allows us to use NPM which is great when it comes to installing, including and overall managing a variety of packages.
* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
  * As certified AWS Cloud Practitioners, we will be using AWS to deploy and host our web app. AWS is among the most used cloud platforms and we are all familiar with how it works.
* Terraform
  * When it comes to infrastructure, it is always a good idea to automate it. Using Terraform, we can build our infrastructure as a code making our deployment process much faster and less of a headache.
